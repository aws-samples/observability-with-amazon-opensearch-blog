# Microservice Observability with Amazon OpenSearch Service Blog

Amazon OpenSearch Serviceâ€™s Observability functionality allows you to go beyond simple monitoring to understand not just what events are happening, but why they are happening. In this blog, learn how to instrument, collect, and analyze metrics, traces, and log data all the way from user front ends to service backends and everything in between. Put this together with Amazon OpenSearch Service, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, FluentBit, and Data Prepper.
